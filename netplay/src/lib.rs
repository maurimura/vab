//! Rollback netplay for the players at a cabinet (up to 4), run by the emulator worker
//! (web/emulator/worker.js) next to the FBNeo core. GGRS decides when to save, load and run
//! frames; the worker does it on the core, through the `Machine` it passes in. Packets go in
//! and out as bytes addressed by player (GGRS handles 0..players, in seat order), and the page
//! carries them between the players.
//!
//! A session has a fixed set of players. When someone joins or leaves, the page starts a new
//! session for everyone from one machine's capture, so GGRS never has to drop a player.
//!
//! The session also keeps each frame's inputs, so the worker can stream the game to people
//! watching it: frames no input can change anymore, from a state no rollback can change.
